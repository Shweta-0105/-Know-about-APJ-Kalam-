            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>BR (/ˈəbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 
                15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
                scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president
                of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim 
                family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and
                aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
                a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) 
                and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was 
                intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
                and military missile development efforts.[2]
                 He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for 
                his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
                vehicle technology.[3][4][5] He also played a pivotal organis
                ational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II 
                nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test
                by India in 1974.[6]
